midnam and middev files for various synths

Why Would You Want These?
=========================
The .middev files actually help to configure the respective synths inside Audio MIDI Setup on Mac OS X. Honestly, though, there's nothing that you couldn't setup yourself, though.

However, the .midnam files contain the factory patch lists and names for the various synths. For DAWs that use these, like Digital Performer, it allows you to choose the patch by name rather than guessing at which number matches the patch you want.

Installation on Mac OS X
========================
0. Navigate to /Library/Audio/MIDI Devices (for computer-wide changes) or ~/Library/Audio/MIDI Devices (for only the current user).
0. Create a new folder for your files. For instance, I created a Dave Smith Instruments folder for the DSI Synths.
0. Copy the .middev _and_ .midname files to this new folder.

You will need to restart your DAW for the changes to have an effect.
